What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a

    Google Docs automatic commits could be bad.  as someone else could look at your code that google atomatically commited, and it may be wrong, and incomplete.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In programming, you work with multiple files.   You may forget to upload one

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	GitLog will give me a summary of the change I made
	GifDiff, similar to FC or Diff -u command.  Tells you the difference in the code ad it will also show you the differences of added/deleted lines of code

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
